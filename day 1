Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for general-purpose programming. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

# Simple Calculator Program
def calculator():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")

    # User input for operation
    choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")

    # Input numbers
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

    if choice == '1':
        print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
    elif choice == '2':
        print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
    elif choice == '3':
        print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
    elif choice == '4':
        if num2 != 0:
            print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")
        else:
            print("Cannot divide by zero.")
    else:
        print("Invalid input!")
